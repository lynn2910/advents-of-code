# advents-of-code

> **Important note:** There will be answers to every daily quest. Be aware that you're spoiling yourself if you haven't already solved it.

## Organisation

Every advent of code will be named after the year of advent. For exemple, the advent of code for the year 2024 will symply be named `2024`. In each year, there will be all folders, going from `01` to `25`, where a folder is the corresponding day.

These directory will have the following files/folders:

- `puzzle.input`: contains the puzzle input to decode
- `inputs`: A folder containing all inputs given to test the solution
- `src`: A folder containing the solution
- `subject.md`: Contains the subject of the day

> **Note:** All tests will be written inside `src/tests`
